Some information about council tax reduction


# Hey, whatcha watching?

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! No. We're on the top. Oh God, what have I done? A sexy mistake. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! __As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.__ *You've killed me!* Oh, you've killed me!

## I'm a thing.

I just told you! You've killed me! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Look, last night was a mistake.

1. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!
2. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!
3. Now what?

### Why not indeed!

Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

* Guess again.
* Throw her in the brig.
* That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

It must be wonderful. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. We don't have a brig.

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. We don't have a brig. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Meh. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Really?! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
