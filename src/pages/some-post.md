# No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Okay, I like a challenge. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

And then the battle's not so bad? Okay, I like a challenge. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? __No.__ *We're on the top.* If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

## No, just a regular mistake.

Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. I just told you! You've killed me! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.

1. I had more, but you go ahead.
2. You are the last hope of the universe.
3. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

### Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Oh yeah, good luck with that. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Please, Don-Botâ€¦ look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! You lived before you met me?! It doesn't look so shiny to me.

* Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.
* You're going to do his laundry?
* And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

And until then, I can never die? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Guess again. Tell them I hate them. I love you, buddy! We're also Santa Claus! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. No, I'm Santa Claus! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Yeah, lots of people did. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

Now what? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Ooh, name it after me! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! No argument here.

What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. You are the last hope of the universe. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

We're rescuing ya. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Then we'll go with that data file! How much did you make me? Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! But existing is basically all I do!
